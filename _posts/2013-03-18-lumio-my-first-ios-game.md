### Lumio - Act fast before the lights go out!

Today I’m launching my first iOS game, Lumio! The whole game took around four weeks to make, from concept through to release and it taught me how to code in Objective-C and how to use Cocos2D.

You can [download the game](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumio/id608072046) on the App Store or [check out the source](https://github.com/joannecdyer/lumio) on GitHub.

Navigate across the lit platforms to collect stars and level up. But be quick, because when the lights go out you'll have to find a different route. Fight against the clock in this fast-paced puzzle game, take too long and it's game over!

I loved every minute developing the game, and the challenges involved. I’m looking for opportunities in SF right now so if you are looking to hire an engineer, then please [get in touch](mailto:support@joannecdyer.com).
